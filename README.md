## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Search for GitHub users by their username
-   See relevant user information based on their search
-   Switch between light and dark themes
-   **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Custom components
-   Custom hooks
-   [React] - JS library
-   [TailwindCSS] - For styles

### What I learned

I had my first opportunity to try localStorage and use it with tailwind darkmode class-based switch functionality.

### Continued development

It was supposed to be a small challange, but in the end it turned out to be great eye-opener. This little side project reminded me to look into Fetch API, Promises and type checking.
